    "We will be working with a dataset of NBA basketball players data (you can get from https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/nba-player-of-the-week the full dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data is a subset of the full dataset containing the players that have the role of Center and of Point Guard. For each player the dataset contains the height, weight and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Center** (C), also known as the five, or the big man, is one of the five positions in a regular basketball game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the NBA, the center is usually 6' 10\" (2.08 m) or taller and usually weighs 240 lbs (109 kg) or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Point Guards** (PG, a.k.a. as \"play maker\") are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. In the NBA, point guards are usually about 6' 3\" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2\" (1.88 m). Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling. \n",

Only for the couple 'height' and 'age' I have a worse result with a training error of 0.2: I can justify it saying that while height is does not depend very much from the age (at least for people older than 20), weight often increase with the age."
