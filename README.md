# Machine_Learning
In this repository I will upload my transcriptions of the lectures of the Machine Learning course, held by professor Pietro Zanuttigh, for the master degree in Physics of Data.




UPDATE   7-02-2020
I need to fix a few errors that I have found during my studies. Anyway, the paper is still missing deep learning lectures, that I will complete in the next months, if I find the time.
